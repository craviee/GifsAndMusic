\section{Development} % Major section

As I said in Section \ref{sec:tec} in this work we have HTML, CSS and JS.

The function of HTML is place the elements that the JS will change, and the CSS will stylize. This is the case of the youtube box and buttons.

The function of CSS is to stylize the page, and apply some cool effects, like round corners and place the wallpaper.

The function of JS is to change elements of JS. When I press a button to move to the next slide, the JS will change the background and play other music in youtube.

It is a very simple program.

\subsection{Run}

You have two options to run this program.

The first one is the simplest and basically you just need to access the publish website \cite{heroku}.

Or you can follow these steps of cloning my Github repo \cite{craviee}
\begin{enumerate}

	\item Open a Linux terminal
	
	\item Type: git clone https://github.com/craviee/GifsAndMusic.git
	
	\item Go to the folder you just downloaded and go to html folder
	
	\item Open the home.html with your favorite browser
	
\end{enumerate}
