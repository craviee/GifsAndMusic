\section{Introduction} % Major section

This work explains the motive, the tecnology behind and of course, what is the \textit{Gifs and Musics} program.

The program is basically a web page that has many slides. Each one of this slides has a gif background and a music.
 
You could also ask me why this essay is so short, and that is because there is no much to say.

The code of this project can be found in my Github \cite{craviee}, and the published version of this work can be found in Heroku \cite{heroku}.

\subsection{Motive} % Sub-section

This is a good question, the reason why I made this program is that I thought it was a good idea, no more and no less.

Sorry, I can not control myself.

\subsection{Tecnology} % Sub-section
\label{sec:tec}

Well, since this program is a web page, we have HTML, CSS and JS.
It is important to say that the music that plays in the page is from Youtube.
